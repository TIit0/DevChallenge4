CSS Grid!

## Process:

apply a Scalable grid!

- I had recently seen a super cool technique were you made your Grid scalable to any device and i Really wanted to practice it, I actually ended up spending more time creating a template i could use for future reference then actually implementing it in the project

2. Implment the template

- after building the template it was just a matter of putting the images and changing the grid sizes

Thanks for Reading!
